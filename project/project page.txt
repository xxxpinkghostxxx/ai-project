üéØ Core Vision
To create a self-organizing neural architecture that develops emergent intelligence through energy-based node dynamics and gradual sensory expansion.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
Foundation Components

Fixed Sensory Layer

Energy-neutral nodes
Direct mapping to input sources (screen pixels, audio, etc.)
No competition for resources
Immutable but connectible


Dynamic Processing Layer

Energy-governed nodes and connections
Self-organizing based on information utility
Subject to growth and pruning


Internal Workspace

Designated area for manipulation and "imagination"
Self-modifiable representation space
Bridge between perception and action



Node Properties

Energy level
Connection list
Information channels
Creation timestamp
Activity history
Energy generation/consumption rates

Connection Properties

Source and destination nodes
Weight/strength
Formation timestamp
Activity metrics
Energy transfer capacity


‚ö° Energy Economy Rules
Generation

Energy is generated when connections carry useful information
More predictive connections generate more energy
Novel information pathways receive energy bonuses

Consumption

Maintaining connections costs energy
Creating new connections costs energy
Idle nodes consume baseline energy
Complex operations (like workspace manipulation) have higher costs

Balance Mechanics

Nodes die when energy falls to zero
Excess energy enables connection formation or node spawning
Energy can be transferred between connected nodes
Energy generation should slightly exceed costs for stable growth

üìä Feature Evaluation Checklist
When considering new features, evaluate against these criteria:

Necessity: Does it serve the core vision?
Timing: Is the system stable enough for this addition?
Integration: How does it interact with existing components?
Energy Impact: What are the energy economy implications?
Complexity: Does it add disproportionate implementation complexity?
Measurability: Can its impact be objectively measured?
Emergence: Does it enable new emergent behaviors?
Control: Are appropriate safeguards included?


üîÑ Development Workflow
