## Code Quality Improvements & Bug Fixes

### Critical Bugs Fixed ✅
1. **Recursive `is_alive` Property**

   - **Issue**: Code referenced undefined constant
   - **Fix**: Added `NODE_TYPE_HIGHWAY = 3` and updated type names list

   - **Fix**: Added `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` at module level

4. **Import Issues in PyG Implementation**
   - **Issue**: Relative import might fail depending on module structure
   - **Fix**: Added graceful fallback for CUDA kernels import
