## üéØ Core Vision

To create a self-organizing neural architecture that develops emergent intelligence through energy-based node dynamics and gradual sensory expansion.

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Foundation Components

- **Fixed Sensory Layer**
  - Energy-neutral nodes
  - Direct mapping to input sources (screen pixels, audio, etc.)
  - No competition for resources
  - Immutable but connectible

- **Dynamic Processing Layer**
  - Energy-governed nodes and connections
  - Self-organizing based on information utility
  - Subject to growth and pruning

- **Internal Workspace**
  - Designated area for manipulation and "imagination"
  - Self-modifiable representation space
  - Bridge between perception and action

---

## üß¨ Node & Connection Properties

- **Node Properties:** Energy level, connection list, information channels, creation timestamp, activity history, energy generation/consumption rates
- **Connection Properties:** Source & destination nodes, weight/strength, formation timestamp, activity metrics, energy transfer capacity

---

## ‚ö° Energy Economy Rules

- **Generation:** Energy is generated when connections carry useful information; predictive and novel connections yield more energy
- **Consumption:** Maintaining/creating connections and idle nodes consume energy; complex operations cost more
- **Balance:** Nodes die at zero energy; excess energy enables growth; energy can be transferred; generation should slightly exceed costs for stability

## üìà Development Roadmap

**Phase 1: Visual Foundation**
- Grayscale screen capture at reduced resolution
- Basic node energy mechanics
- Initial connection formation
- Visual pattern detection emergence

**Phase 2: Enhanced Visual Processing**
- Higher resolution
- Color channels
- Motion detection
- Visual workspace

**Phase 3: Multimodal Expansion**
- Audio input
- Text recognition from screen
- Cross-modal associations

**Phase 4: Interaction Capabilities**
- Mouse/keyboard output nodes
- Action-perception feedback loops

**Phase 5: Advanced Features**
- Long-term memory
- Meta-learning
- Self-modification of system parameters
- Enhanced control safeguards

## üîç Monitoring Metrics

- **System Health:** Total energy, node birth/death, connection formation/pruning, processing efficiency
- **Emergent Capabilities:** Pattern recognition, novel connections, information compression, adaptive response
- **Performance:** Update speed, memory usage, GPU utilization, energy calculation efficiency

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Guidelines

- **Design Principles:** Start simple, expand gradually, keep changes measurable, optimize for emergence and energy efficiency, adapt to input, control growth
- **Code Structure:** Core engine is separate; fixed & dynamic components are modular; uses efficient sparse matrix ops and visualizations; highly configurable
- **Technical Requirements:** Multi-threading, GPU acceleration, efficient data structures, circular buffers for history

---

## üß™ Experimentation Framework

- **Parameters to Tune:** Energy allocation/rates, thresholds, spawning conditions, info value, update frequencies
- **Test Scenarios:** Static/dynamic scenes, pattern recognition, novel stimulus, adaptation, resource constraints
- **Success Indicators:** Stable node population, specialized clusters, efficient pathways, adaptive inputs, reduced recurring energy use

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Considerations

- **Stability:** Prevent energy inflation/deflation, catastrophic node death, and runaway loops; enforce resource limits
- **Control:** Emergency shutdown, parameter resets, growth limiters, energy tools, and robust monitoring

## üìä Feature Evaluation Checklist

1. Necessity: Does it serve the core vision?
2. Timing: Is the system stable enough for this addition?
3. Integration: How does it interact with existing components?
4. Energy Impact: What are the energy economy implications?
5. Complexity: Does it add disproportionate implementation complexity?

## üîÑ Development Workflow

1. Propose features with purpose and outcomes
2. Evaluate using the Feature Checklist
3. Implement in an isolated branch
4. Test and measure at increasing scale
5. Document emergent behaviors
6. Integrate only when proven stable/beneficial
7. Monitor for unexpected interactions post-integration
