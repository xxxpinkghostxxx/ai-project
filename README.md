## 🎯 Core Vision

Our mission: Create a self-organizing neural architecture that learns and adapts through energy-driven node dynamics and ever-expanding senses. In simpler terms, we want to build something that grows, discovers, and surprises us—much like real intelligence.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Building Blocks

- **Fixed Sensory Layer**
  - Maps directly to inputs (like screen pixels or audio)
  - Nodes here don’t compete for resources—they’re always available
  - These nodes are stable, but others can connect to them

- **Dynamic Processing Layer**
  - Nodes and connections here compete for and use energy
  - They grow, shrink, and self-organize, always trying to make sense of things

- **Internal Workspace**
  - A special place for “imagination” and flexible thinking
  - Here, the system can combine perceptions and plan actions

---

## 🧬 How Nodes & Connections Work

- **Node Properties:** Each node tracks its energy, its connections, what info it handles, when it was made, its activity, and how it uses or generates energy.
- **Connection Properties:** Every connection knows its source/target, strength, age, activity, and how much energy it can carry.

---

## ⚡ The Energy Economy

- **Making Energy:** When connections move useful, predictive, or novel info, they generate energy.
- **Spending Energy:** It costs energy to create or maintain nodes and connections—especially the more complex ones.
- **Staying Balanced:** If a node runs out of energy, it’s removed. Extra energy fuels growth. Ideally, energy made slightly exceeds what’s spent, so the system stays alive and vibrant.

## 📈 Roadmap: How We Grow

**Phase 1: Visual Foundation**
- Capture grayscale screen images (at low resolution)
- Establish energy mechanics and basic connection rules
- Watch for first signs of pattern recognition

**Phase 2: Better Vision**
- Add color and higher resolution
- Detect motion
- Build a visual workspace

**Phase 3: Multi-Sense Expansion**
- Introduce audio and text inputs
- Link information between senses

**Phase 4: Interaction**
- Enable mouse and keyboard outputs
- Complete the loop between perception and action

**Phase 5: Smarter Features**
- Build memory and learning about learning (“meta-learning”)
- Let the system tweak its own parameters
- Add strong safety and control measures

---

## 🔍 How We Measure Progress

- **System Health:** Total energy, how often nodes/connections are created or removed, efficiency
- **Emergent Skills:** Detecting patterns, making new connections, responding adaptively
- **Performance:** Processing speed, memory/GPU use, energy efficiency

---

## ⚙️ How We Build

- **Keep It Simple:** Start with basics, add complexity only when needed
- **Focus on Emergence:** Let interesting behaviors arise naturally
- **Stay Modular:** Core engine, sensory, and processing layers are kept separate and easy to tinker with
- **Tech Stack:** Multi-threaded, GPU-accelerated, using efficient data structures and circular buffers for history

---

## 🧪 Experiment and Play

- **What to Tune:** Energy flow rates, creation thresholds, update speeds, etc.
- **Test Ideas:** Feed in static and dynamic scenes, see how the system adapts and recognizes patterns
- **Success Looks Like:** Stable but adaptable networks, efficient paths, creative solutions

---

## 🛡️ Safety First

- **Stability:** Guard against runaway growth or collapse, prevent energy “inflation” or “death spirals”
- **Controls:** Emergency stop, reset options, growth limits, live monitoring

## 📊 Feature Checklist

Before adding a new feature, ask:
1. Does it support our main goal?
2. Is it the right time for this?
3. Will it play nicely with what’s already here?
4. How will it affect energy use?
5. Is it too complex?
6. Can we measure its impact?
7. Will it enable new, emergent behaviors?
8. Are safety measures included?

---

## 🔄 How We Work

1. Propose—share your idea or feature
2. Evaluate—use the checklist above
3. Build—it in a separate branch
4. Test—start small, then scale up
5. Document—note anything new or interesting that emerges
6. Merge—only when it’s stable and valuable
7. Watch—monitor for surprises after it’s live
