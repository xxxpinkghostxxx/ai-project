## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: DGL Compatibility
The core blocker is **DGL (Deep Graph Library) version incompatibility**:
- Available versions: 0.1.0, 0.1.2, 0.1.3 (too old)
- Required: DGL 2.0+ for Python 3.13 compatibility
- Problem: Old DGL uses deprecated `collections.Mapping` (moved to `collections.abc` in Python 3.9+)

### Secondary Issue: GUI Dependencies  
- Tkinter not available in container environment
- Requires system-level package installation
- Affects UI and some utility systems

## Recommended Fixes

### 1. DGL Compatibility (Priority: HIGH)
```bash
# Option A: Use compatible Python version
# Use Python 3.8-3.11 with older DGL versions

# Option B: Update to modern DGL
pip install dgl-cu121 -f https://data.dgl.ai/wheels/repo.html

# Option C: Manual fix for collections import
# Patch dgl/utils.py to use collections.abc
```

### 2. GUI Dependencies (Priority: MEDIUM)
```bash
# Install system package
sudo apt update && apt install python3-tk

# Or use headless mode for testing
```

### 3. Alternative Testing Approach (Priority: IMMEDIATE)
- Create DGL-free test modes
- Mock neural system for UI testing  
- Focus on vision and configuration systems

## System Strengths

### Excellent Architecture ‚úÖ
- Well-structured modular design
- Comprehensive configuration system
- Energy-based learning paradigm is innovative
- Multi-threaded processing design
- Good separation of concerns

### Working Subsystems ‚úÖ
- **Vision System:** Ready for screen capture
- **Configuration:** Flexible parameter management
- **PyTorch Integration:** Modern ML backend available
- **Image Processing:** Full pipeline ready

### Documentation Quality ‚úÖ
- Clear README with project vision
- Detailed configuration parameters
- Well-commented code structure
- Contributing guidelines present

## Potential Workarounds

### 1. CPU-Only Testing
```python
# Disable GPU features for testing
USE_GPU = False
# Test with smaller networks
MAX_PROCESSING_NODES = 1000
```

### 2. Mock Neural System
```python
# Create simplified neural system for testing
class MockNeuralSystem:
    def __init__(self, width, height, n_dynamic, workspace_size):
        self.ready = True
    
    def start_connection_worker(self, batch_size):
        pass
```

### 3. Headless Mode
```python
# Run without GUI for basic functionality testing
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Skip UI initialization
    # Test core logic only
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Resource Requirements
- **Memory:** ~1GB minimum (up to 1024MB configured)
